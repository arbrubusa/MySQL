### BASIC MASTER MYSQL CONFIGURATION FOR A 16GB SERVER USING GTID

#
# The MySQL database server configuration file.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
#
# For explanations see
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html

# Here is entries for some specific programs
# The following values assume you have at least 32M ram

# changed. Ref https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_tmpdir

#
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
